        <h1 style="color: red; font-size: 20px">About Cthulhu Simulator game</h1>
        A proof of concept prototype of a first person horror game. In this prototype we utilised water movement mechanics and puzzle mechanics to create an immersive and atmospheric snippet of a potential project. In this game the player controls a submariner who is investigating a strange nuclear disaster that had recently occurred in the Pacific ocean. As the player dives deeper they will be confronted and lulled into a mysterious temple by a threatening presence. The player becomes trapped in the temple and must locate a way out. We used puzzle mechanics and atmospheric horror as our basis of design throughout. The player must locate cryptic solutions to puzzles as they traverse a broken and ruined temple - facing their demons and mysterious beings as they delve deeper into the roots of the temple. To further horror design we incorporated immerseive sound design and incorporated several encounters with monsters - including cthulhu himself!
