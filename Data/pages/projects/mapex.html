        <li>Programmer: I did C# programming for the entire game project that involved - Game core mechanics(player-movements, interactable scattered notes, controlled Nightmare characters that helps the player do objectives in the game), AI System(boss Spider, Nightmare characters),Interactable trap cage & locked door</li>
        <li>Game Cutscene: Player sleeping cutscene (start of the game and end of the game)</li>
        <li>Animator: I did the rigging and animation setup for the nightmare characters, tiny-Spiders & Boss Spider in unity with the help of Mixamo(A program that rigs humanoid models and it has animation samples to use for your 3D Model</li>

        <h1 style="color: red; font-size: 20px">About Artist Garden Gamejam game</h1>
        Domestic Nightmares is a collaboration game that we created during a game GameJam with the 3d animations students.
        <br>
        <br>
        It is based on the artwork of Louise Bourgeois a french artist. We used her work to inspire our game and tried to convey themes potrayed in her artwork in our game.
        <br>
        <br>
        The build was made from Unity game engine but the 3d animation students used Unreal Engine to create how the scene would look like. We then used the scene to as a reference to recreate it in unity.
        <br>
        <br>
        I feel that this project gave me a boosted confidence to work and collaborate with people and being able to handle game management overall.
