        <h1 style="color: red; font-size: 20px">About Project Eve game</h1>
        Project Eve is a game where you play the role of a clone designed to defend a Cargo ship that is transporting weapons and supplies for the military of the Gallente Federation. The shipâ€™s main goal is to safely deliver all cargo to a command center as the faction prepares for an invasion. On the route to the command center, the ship is attacked by space pirates and ruthless bandits looking to steal the resources aboard the ship. These bandits are like the sharks in the sea, grabbing anything they can get their hands on. The ship, being full of cargo and valuable resources make it an ideal target for the bandits. The space pirates will start to dock at the ship's two docking stations looking to steal everything. However after learning of the highly valuable fusion core that powers the ship, stealing it would be their top priority. If they can get their hands on the fusion core, the pirates will easily be able to outrun any opposing ships in most sectors of the universe, an ideal technical upgrade for thieves. The fusion core is a Micro Auxiliary Power Core II model, a power source that is typically far too expensive for most common pirates to obtain. This model acts as one of the main power sources of the entire ship, without it the ship will simply float through space, ripe for pillage of valuable Gallente Federation supplies. To stop these items falling into unwanted hands, the cargo ship - A new variant of the Charon model - Has a self-destruct protocol that activates when the fusion core is removed, this procedure takes two minutes, with the cargo ship powering up for a devastating blast that will hopefully annihilate any invaders. The fusion core is located in the power reactor room and controlled only by authorized and trusted personnel. The game starts after pirates have begun attacking the cargo ship, and all crew members have been forced to flee via escape pods. And you - A secret clone superweapon - has been deployed to defend the ship from all its attackers. Your goal is to eliminate all threats without getting caught or killed by enemies.
